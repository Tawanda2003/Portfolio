              I'm <span className="text-black dark:text-white font-semibold">Tawanda Gweshe</span>, a passionate
              Front-End Developer who began my coding journey from scratch â€” starting with visual platforms like Scratch
              to build simple games and animations. That experience fueled my curiosity and led me into web development.
            </p>

            <p>
              I specialize in creating{" "}
              <span className="text-black dark:text-white font-medium">
                responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications
              </span>{" "}
              using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Next.js. I also work with Supabase for backend services
              like databases and authentication.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, I have some knowledge of{" "}
              <span className="text-black dark:text-white font-medium">Python</span>, a powerful backend programming
              language widely used for server-side development, scripting, and data processing.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also understand the basics of{" "}
              <span className="text-black dark:text-white font-medium">UI/UX design and digital marketing</span>, which
              helps me build digital experiences that are both functional and user-focused. I'm always learning and
              excited to grow as a developer by exploring new technologies and building real-world projects.
